Hey there! If you’ve ever felt overwhelmed by bills or worried about not having enough savings, you’re not alone. I’ve been there too, and I’ve discovered that having a clear **savings plan**—and making sure I **pay myself first**—is one of the best ways to stay on top of your personal finances in the UK. You may have heard about "paying yourself first", and probably wonder what the heck does that mean, but don't worry, I'll explain everything for you!

In this post, I’ll walk you through my simple, beginner-friendly approach to **save money in 2025**. I’ll use a real-life example (salary, bills, and all) to explain how it works. Plus, I’ve included extra resources, a handy budget table, and even a **52 envelopes** system to keep your savings organised. Let’s dive in!

## 1. Know Your Take-Home Pay

Begin by figuring out exactly how much money lands in your bank account each month—this is your net (after-tax) income. For this example:

- **Yearly salary:** £40,000  
- **Monthly net (after-tax):** ~£2,680

**Why This Matters:**  
Every effective budgeting or **save money challenge** begins with knowing exactly how much you truly have to work with. If you’re unsure about your deductions, try using an online calculator such as this [Tax Calculator](https://www.thesalarycalculator.co.uk/salary.php) for a more accurate figure.

## 2. Identify Fixed Expenses

Next, list all your non-negotiable expenses—things like rent, utilities, and essential services. In my case, that looks like:

- **Rent & shared bills:** £950  
- **Internet:** £30  
- **Mobile phone:** £10

Right from the start, £990 is set aside to cover these basics.

**Pro Tip:**  
Set these bills on auto-pay (direct debit) so you never miss a due date. This simple trick helps you **save money** and avoid surprises later in the month.

## 3. Pay Yourself First

This is the real game-changer. Decide on the amount you want to save before spending on anything else.

Before you commit, work out a realistic figure for your monthly spending. For example, if you work from home (WFH) like I do, you might have fewer commuting costs. Let’s say:

- **Personal spending (groceries, small treats, etc.):** £500

This category covers all your day-to-day expenses—food, the occasional takeaway, a little entertainment, etc.

**Pro Tip:**  
Break that £500 down into weekly amounts (approximately £125 per week) to help avoid overspending early in the month.

## 4. Calculate Your Savings

Now, let’s see what’s left:

> **Monthly take-home:** £2,680  
> **Less Fixed Bills:** £990  
> **Less Personal Spending:** £500  
> **Equals Savings:** £1,190

This £1,190 is what I save immediately—transferred to a separate savings or investment account at the start of each month. This ensures you always prioritise **saving money** over discretionary spending.

**How Much After 12 Months?**

> £1,190 × 12 = **£14,280**

Imagine having £14,280 saved by the end of the year—a straightforward and effective plan!

## 5. Quick Reference Budget Table

Sometimes it helps to see everything at a glance. Here’s a simple breakdown of my monthly budget:

| **Category**          | **Amount** | **Details**                                        |
|-----------------------|------------|----------------------------------------------------|
| **Net Income**        | £2,680     | Your monthly take-home pay                         |
| **Fixed Bills**       | £990       | Rent (£950), Internet (£30), Mobile (£10)          |
| **Personal Spending** | £500       | Groceries, small extras (~£125/week)               |
| **Savings**           | £1,190     | Automatically transferred to a separate account    |

Use this table as a template. If your income or bills differ, simply plug in your numbers to see how much you can realistically save.

## 6. The 52 Envelopes Method

To further enhance your savings strategy, consider using the **52 envelopes** method. This technique is a practical, tangible way to manage your money:

- **Step 1:** Label 52 envelopes—one for each week of the year.  
- **Step 2:** Allocate a portion of your savings each week into a designated envelope.  
- **Step 3:** This method not only helps you track your progress but also challenges you to **save money every day**.

This approach pairs well with digital solutions such as a **save money app free** or a traditional **save money account** where you can monitor your weekly deposits and watch your savings grow. I am adding this one here, as I know that some people get overwhelmed by the use of digital tools. Personally I don't use this method, I prefer to transfer my savings into a ISA, an Investment Account or some savings account I keep on the side.

## 7. Try My Free 50/30/20 Budget Planner

Enhance your budgeting even further with our interactive **50/30/20 Budget Planner**. Use the tool below to allocate your monthly net income between essentials (50%), discretionary spending (30%), and savings (20%). It’s a great way to see how your money is distributed and to start planning for a financially secure 2025. This one is very tricky if you are London-based like myself, originally that was my approach, but I understand that London is QUITE expensive, so keeping the essentials at 50% can be tricky.


## 8. Why This Approach Works

- **Pay Yourself First:**  
  By transferring money into savings immediately, you’re building a financial cushion each month rather than waiting to see what’s left over.

- **Clear Weekly Limit:**  
  Dividing personal spending into weekly amounts (about £125) helps prevent impulsive splurges.

- **Stress-Free Structure:**  
  With fixed amounts allocated for bills, personal expenses, and savings, budgeting becomes almost automatic—allowing you to **save money and get interest** on your savings in the long run.

## 10. Making It Stick

- **Automate Your Savings:**  
  Set up a standing order from your main account to your savings account on payday. This way, you always **save money without touching it**.
  
- **Stay Flexible:**  
  Some months might have extra expenses—car repairs, birthdays, etc. Adjust your plan slightly, but keep the overall goal intact. Consider options like **save money auto sales reviews** or tweaking your **save money car insurance** if needed.
  
- **Review Regularly:**  
  Every 3-6 months, revisit your budget. If your bills have increased or you can switch providers to **save money on energy bills** or **save money on subscriptions**, make those tweaks. Small adjustments can lead to significant gains over time.

## Final Thoughts

Budgeting isn’t about deprivation; it’s about giving every pound a purpose. By allocating funds for bills, personal spending, and, most importantly, savings, you can pay your bills, enjoy life, and work towards big financial goals—whether it’s a deposit on a house, building a comfortable emergency fund, or planning a well-deserved holiday.

By choosing to **pay myself first**, I’m on track to save **£14,280** in one year while living in London. Follow a similar plan, adjust it to suit your own numbers, and explore the recommended resources along the way. You’ll be amazed at how quickly your savings can grow.

Good luck on your budgeting journey, and here’s to a more financially secure 2025!
